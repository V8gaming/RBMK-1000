## Introduction

RBMK-1000 Simulator is a tool for simulating the behavior of the RBMK-1000 reactor used at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. The simulator allows users to explore different scenarios and experiment with the control of the reactor, without the risk of a real-life disaster. By providing a safe and controlled environment for testing, RBMK-1000 Simulator can help improve the safety and reliability of nuclear power plants worldwide.

## Commands

* help (page) - display this page.
* insert rod (rod number) - insert a fuel rod.
* remove rod (rod number) - remove a fuel rod.
* insert rods - insert all fuel rods.
* pull rods - remove all fuel rods.
* scram - remove all fuel rods.
* setpoint (setpoint) - set all fuel rods to a setpoint.
* set rod (rod number) to (setpoint) - set a fuel rod to a setpoint.
* cls - clear the log.
* center core only - insert only the center core.
* setpoint speed (slow|medium|fast) - set the speed of the setpoint change.
* hold rods - hold the rods in place.

## Dev Commands
* dev sp (position)- change the position of the absorber rods to position.

## Simulation levels
## Level 0
* Everything based on the position of the absorber rods.
* Only the reactor core, and steam turbine is simulated.

## Level 1
* water amounts are simulated.
* electrical power generated from the turbine is simulated.
* Radioactivity of the fuel rods is simulated.

## Level 2
* Flux rate is based on the composition of the fuel rods.
* water composition and deaerator is simulated.
* Fuel burnup is simulated.

## Level 3
* malfunctions are simulated.
* accounting is simulated.
